            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <blockquote id="bio">
                <p>Michael Jeffrey Jordan, born February 17, 1963 in Brooklyn, New York, is widely considered one of the
                    greatest basketball players of all time. Jordan grew up in Wilmington, North Carolina, where he
                    began to excel in basketball in high school.
                    After a standout college career at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he won the
                    1982 NCAA championship, Jordan was selected by the Chicago Bulls with the third overall pick in the
                    1984 NBA Draft.
                    During his career with the Bulls, Jordan led the team to six NBA championships in the 1990s, winning
                    the NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) award five times. His outstanding athletic ability, scoring
                    ability, and competitive intensity made him a sporting icon and globally recognized figure.
                    In addition to his success in the NBA, Jordan represented the United States at the 1984 Olympic
                    Games in Los Angeles, winning the gold medal, and again at the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona,
                    being part of the legendary "Dream Team" who also won gold.
                    After retiring from professional basketball for the first time in 1993, Jordan dabbled in baseball
                    before returning to the Bulls in 1995 and continuing his dominance in the league until his final
                    retirement in 2003.
                    After his playing career, Jordan has dedicated himself to the business world and is known for his
                    Air Jordan brand, a line of sports shoes and clothing that has achieved extraordinary success. He is
                    also the majority owner of the Charlotte Hornets NBA team.
                    Michael Jordan has left a lasting legacy in basketball and popular culture, being an icon not only
                    in the sports world, but also in the business world and society in general.
